# Design patterns in Java
###### Learn all about Design patterns in Java
### Defined
- **Design patterns** are general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems.
- It is a description or a template for **how to solve a problem** that can be used in many different situations.
- The **best practices** that a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

> "A design that doesn't take change into account risks major redesign in the future." ― Erich Gamma

### Why?
- Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
- Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems.
- Improve code readability for coders and architects.
- Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem.

### Types of Design Patterns
- **Creational**
- **Structural**
- **Behavioural**

## Creational Design Pattern
> Creational patterns are focused towards **How to instantiate an object** or group of related objects.

In **software engineering**, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **[Simple Factory](https://medium.com/nestedif/java-simple-factory-pattern-9c2538dd0265)**
- **[Factory Method](https://medium.com/nestedif/java-factory-method-976cf4e12ec0)**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**
- **Singleton**

## Structural Design Patterns
> Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other. It answers "**How to build a software component?**"

In **software engineering**, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.
- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Proxy**

## Behavioral Design Patterns
> It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. It answers "**How to run a behavior in software component?**"

What makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication between them.

In **software engineering**, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Command**
- **Iterator**
- **Mediator**
- **Memento**
- **Observer**
- **Visitor**
- **Strategy**
- **State**
- **Template Method**
